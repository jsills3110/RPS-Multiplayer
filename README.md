### Contributing

This project was meant to be an exercise in Firebase for my coding bootcamp. While you are more than welcome to fork the 
repository and modify the game for yourself, I will likely not accept pull requests. However, if you choose to review the
code and you have questions or comments for me, I am more than happy to hear them! In fact, I'd love to receive feedback on 
my code. Please feel free to email me at the address listed on my Github account.
